Hi Agnieszka, 

I have known about Sigmoidal for a while and I find it amazing that they build AI 
systems for companies in a variety of industries and bring excellent results. This 
must be a sign that you must be a great People Operations Manager and can put together
an amazing team with quality talent. I have experience with Data Science, Deep Learning
and NLP in particular and was wondering if I could leverage my skills in a way that can
bring value to Sigmoidal.I'd also be interested to hear about your transition from
your background in medicine to this line of work. Would it be possible to chat about 
Sigmoidal? I'd be available after 1PM (GMT+1).

Best, Spencer

 
Hi Samarth, 

I see you're a Data Scientist at Ranker and have extensive experiance in the Data and
Analytics space. I also see you worked on the color detection algorithm at Walmart and 
I'd be very interested to hear about your experiance at Walmart Labs. I recently 
graduated from Flatiron's Data Science Bootcamp and  noticed that Ranker has a job 
opening for a Junior Data Scientist to help Ranker expand it's initiatives, which is 
something I'd be interested in. Would it be possible to have a chat about these topics? 
A time in the afternoon would be best.

Best regards, Spencer

Hi Janet, 

I see that your agency has a unique and effective approach to Digital Marketing. I'm 
interested to hear about how you discovered the power of animated explainer videos, and
started an agency centered around it. With experiance in Data Science, I'm also wondering
if my skills in Data Science could help your agency in any way. Would it be possible to 
chat about your agency? Somewhere between 4 to 7 pm on a weekday would be prefferable.
