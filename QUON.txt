Can't stay at home, can't stay at school.
Old folks say 'You poor little fool'.
Down the streets I'm the girl next door.
I'm the fox you've been waiting for.
Hello, daddy. Hello, mom.
I'm your ch-ch-ch-cherry bomb!
Hello world! I'm your wild girl.
I'm your ch-ch-ch-cherry bomb!
Stone age love and strange sounds too.

Bad nights causing teenage blues.

I'll give you something to live for.
Have you and grab you until you're sore.
Hello, daddy. Hello, mom.

I don't like to live alone
Along the Avenue
I can't go back to bein' straight
I seem to get on you.
Is it day or night
Porcupine kiss, novacane lips
Is it day or night
White flowers wheep and they want to sleep
And then dog eat dog tonight.
Back door to insanity
Was ripped from their throats
Street white huffers are sittin' relaxed
It's cold in their over coats.
Is it day or night
Porcupine kiss, novacane lips
Is it day or night
White flowers wheep and they want to sleep
And then dog eat dog tonight.
Is it day or night
Porcupine kiss, novacane lips
Is it day or night
White flowers wheep and they want to sleep
And then dog eat dog tonight.

When the moon is out it starts to shine
Thunder crashes want to make you mine
The sky lights up in my mind
Fireworks between us you'll find
And its thunder
The spell that I'm under
It's thunder
I see lightning crash
And its thunder
Oh how our love flashes
It's thunder
Don't need no other feeling
All the others their just the same
But oh my baby your a hurricane
Let me be your battered angel
So you can be my tattered devil
And its thunder
The spell that I'm under
It's thunder
I see lightning crash
And its thunder
Oh how our love flashes
It's thunder
Don't need no other feeling
Your my teenage fire
That's in my heart
Now our flaming love is gonna start
Oh its gonna start

Jenny said, when she was just five years old
There was nothin' happening at all
Every time she puts on the radio
There was nothin' goin' down at all, not at all
Then, one fine mornin', she puts on a New York station
You know, she couldn't believe what she heard at all
She started shakin' to that fine, fine music
You know, her life was saved by rock'n'roll
Despite all the imputations
You know, you could just go out
And dance to a rock'n'roll station
And it was all right, hey baby,
You know, it was all right
Jenny said, when she was just about five years old
`You know, my parents are gonna be the death of us all
Two TV sets and two Cadillac cars
Well, you know, ain't gonna help me at all
Then, one fine morning, she turns on a New York station
She doesn't believe what she hears at all
Ooh, she started dancin' to that fine, fine music
You know, her life was saved by rock'n'roll
Yeah, rock'n'roll
Despite all the computations
You could just dance to that rock'n'roll station
And baby, it was all right, yeah
Hey, it was all right
Hey, here she comes now
Jenny said, when she was just about five years old
'Hey, you know, there's nothin' happening at all, not at all
Every time I put on the radio
You know, there's nothin' goin' down at all, not at all
But, one fine morning, she hears a New York station
She couldn't believe what she heard at all, hey, not at all
She started dancing to that fine, fine music
You know, her life was saved by rock'n'roll
Yes, rock'n'roll
Despite all the computations
You know, you could just dance to the rock'n'roll station
All right
All right, all right, and it was all right
Oh, listen to me now, it was all right
Come on now, believe me, it was all right

I want something bad and nice, hot love
I want it nice from paradise, your love
All night long I'm chasing fast, true love
Make me scream, make it fast
We lovers never say goodbye
We lovers never die
We stop and go so quietly
Cold lovers fade away
I'm the one for you
You know what I say is true
I won't cry to tell you why
I know that you love me too
You do a one, two, three, four
Oh yeah come on now
I want a kiss wet and real, strong love
I want to tell you how I feel, right now
All night long it rained and rained, my love
Make me scream hey what's your name?
We lovers never say goodbye
We lovers never die
We stop and go so quietly
Cold lovers fade away

Clean rock n roll
Makes the midnight flow tonight now
It's hot tonight
Come on let's have a good time
In the dark of the night
We hunt for fun
Chasing after the moonlight
Hiding from the sun
American nights
You kids are so strange
American nights
You're never gonna change
Our magic is young
Cause we just begun
We light up the sky
Always on the run
We live in the streets
In the alleys of screams
Cause we're the queens of noise
The answer to your dreams
American nights
You kids are so strange
American nights
You're never gonna change
Hey boy you're my good time
Dance close ya feel so fine
Hold tight we're on fire
All night you're my desire
Everybody
Wanna party
Everybody
Wanna party
American nights
You kids are so strange
American nights
You're never gonna change

You didn't care, you went and broke my heart
I'll get you back, you know it's gonna start
You gave me pain, look what you've done to me
When I get through you'll be sorry you met me
You'll wish you were never born
Blackmail, blackmail
I'll make you pay for the life that you tore
Blackmail, blackmail
You put it to me and now we'll play my game
I'll wrap you up and you'll go insane
It took so long and I waited my turn
You pay your debt, I'm gonna make you burn, you know
You'll wish you were never born
Blackmail, blackmail
I'll make you pay for the life that you tore
Blackmail, blackmail
I know about you and I'm gonna tell
The way I planned, you're gonna go through hell
You listen to what I'm about to say
Or you won't live to see the light of day, you know
You'll wish you were never born
Blackmail, blackmail
I'll make you pay for the life that you tore
Blackmail, blackmail
One more time, blackmail, blackmail

We speak in codes and no one knows
Cause we're living a double life
Kept inside our love dreams hide
Cause we're living a double life
Secrets
We're got dreams
Mysteries
And crazy schemes
Secrets
We've got dreams
Secrets
Can't be seen
Out on the street the shadows meet
Cause we're living a double life
We can't tell it fits so well
That's we're living a double life
Secrets
We're got dreams
Mysteries
And crazy schemes
Secrets
We've got dreams
Secrets
Can't be seen
Shhh someones coming
Shhh be quiet
If we get caught
Just deny it

I'm a blond bombshell and I wear it well
You're momma says you go straight to hell
I'm sweet sixteen, a rebel queen
And I look real hot in my tight blue jeans
Dead end kids in the danger zone
All of you are drunk and stoned
Dead end kids, you're not alone
You sleep in the streets when you're not at home
Long hot summers make me wanna fight
The roar of the city lasts all night
You like drugs, you like brew
You won't believe what I may do to you
Dead end kids in the danger zone
All of you are drunk or stoned
Dead end kids, you're not alone
You sleep in the streets when you're not at home
I got away clean with my fake ID
No more school or mommy for me
Stealing cars and breaking hearts
Pills and thrills and acting smart
Dead end kids in the danger zone
All of you are drunk and stoned
Dead end kids, you're not alone
You sleep in the streets when you're not at home
In the naked city
Spaces ain't that pretty
As I was getting dusted
I happened to get busted
Oh yes, I was arrested
Oh God, how I protested
They beat me with a board
It hurt just like a sword
They kicked me in the eye
My brain began to fry
This is like a movie
I know I'm gonna scream
All the pain that I feel
Makes me feel mean
It's so sad and crazy here
I think I'm gonna cry
If I don't wake up from this dream
I think I'm gonna, gonna, gonna die
Where am!?
Your in a cheap run down teenage jail thats where
Oh, my god!
Yeah, blondie your gonna be here till your 18 so get used to it
Behind the bars, there's a superstar
Who never had a chance
She could sing, she could dance
You don't sing and dance in juvie, honey
Behind the walls, they've seen it all
Gotta have, gotta have
Justice, justice
Don't want your law and order
Justice, justice
Or world wide disorder
What you in for?
Wouldn't you like to know
Behind the fence, there is no defense
There's murder, rape and bribery
In and out, burglary
You don't look so tough
Oh, I been around
On the planet sorrow, there is no tommorrow
Gonna get, gonna get
Justice, justice
Don't want your law and order
Justice, justice
Or world wide disorder
You can't turn off the tears
They crawl in juvenile hall
Cruel reform schools
They don't smile, they got no bail or jury trial
Joan, lets break out tonite
Ok Cherie, what's the plan?
You grab the guard, in the prison yard
Get his keys and gun, we'll run
My old man's waiting outside in a van
Is he hot?
You'll see
'Cause you know, we gotta be free
Justice, justice
Don't want your law and order
Justice, justice
Or world wide disorder
We'll go far through the prison yard
You and me, we will be free
Just be safe, don't be late
If you see the guard don't hesitate
But Joan, I'm getting tired
I've run out of fire
I can't go any further
But Cherie, you must try harder
Try harder
Joan, I'm down, my ankle!
I can't go on, but I can't leave you
What do I do?
Save yourself, you know what you gotta do
Oh, my god!

Little Sister on your rollerskates
It's Friday night an' you got a date
Right in front of the Watergate.
But now he's gone 'cause you're too late
It's too late to be a kid in love
It's too late to be a kid in love
We're the kids in hate
Little sister you're sure lookin' great
You hope someday you'll be playmate
Well why did you wait
Your chance is gone an' now you're too late
It's too late to be a kid in love
It's too late to be a kid in love
We're the kids in hate
Little sister don't you be so straight
Let your old folks call ya jailbait
This mean world it belongs to us
It can be yours so don't hesitate(c'mon)
It's too late to be a kid in love
It's too late to be a kid in love
We're the kids in hate

Blue skinned sleeping boys
Man you're lookin' wasted
Greasy wheels, streets of steel
No tellin' what ya tasted
Good guys bad guys
Doesn't really matter
Punch drunk, high on junk
Sad you are so shattered
Wasted lives of wasted drives
Wasted days an' wasted nights
Wasted this an' wasted that
Wasted is where you're at
Torpedoes in tuxedos
Got iron in their hands
Cotton sound, lost an' found
Is in every crazy man
Lonely rain, bad cocaine
Doesn't really matter
China white, don't treat ya right
Sad you are so shattered
Wasted lives of wasted drives
Wasted days an' wasted nights
Wasted this an' wasted that
Wasted is where you're at
Madhouse melodies
Got beach rats on the run
Golden tractors, low plus factors
Silver bullets, rubber gun
Redneck rocker, or devil daughter
Doesn't really matter
Cheap dope, ya can't cope
Sad you are so shattered
Wasted lives of wasted drives
Wasted days an' wasted nights
Wasted this an' wasted that
Wasted is where you're at

In the dead of the night I slip away
Lookin' for some heavy action
No matter what it is, I get that little itch
My body needs satisfaction
Gotta get out tonite
The wild one is callin' me
Gotta get out tonite
Out on the town is where I'll be alright
My folks think I'm bad and you know
They're probably right
But I don't listen to a thing they say
But I don't listen to a thing they say
Cause They're always uptight
My fantasy is strong, it really turns me on
I'm gettin' oh so wet
When will I discover my red hot lover
The one I'll never forget
Gotta get out tonite
The wild one is callin' me
Gotta get out tonite
Out on the town is where I'll be alright

How to get to Hadestown
You'll have to take the long way down
Through the underground, under cover of night
Laying low, staying out of sight
Ain't no compass, brother, there ain't no map
Just a telephone wire and the railroad track
Keep on walking and you don't look back
'Til you get to the bottomland
Wait for me, I'm coming
Wait, I'm coming with you
Wait for me, I'm coming too
I'm coming too
River Styx is high and wide
Cinderbricks and razorwire
Walls of iron and concrete
Hound dogs howling round the gate
Them dogs'll lay down and play dead
If you got the bones, if you got the bread
But if all you got is your own two legs
You best be glad you got 'em
Wait for me, I'm coming
Wait, I'm coming with you
Wait for me, I'm coming too
I'm coming too
You're on the lam, you're on the run
Don't give your name, you don't have one
And don't look no one in the eye
That town will try to suck you dry
They'll suck your brain, they'll suck your breath
They'll pluck the heart right out your chest
They'll truss you up in your Sunday best
And stuff your mouth with cotton
Wait for me, I'm coming
Wait, I'm coming with you
Wait for me, I'm coming too
I'm coming
Wait, wait, wait, wait

Night visions of fantasies
Are laying in bed with me
In the dark I can see you smiling
You touch my body and set my soul on fire
Oh yeh
I can see morning light
The sun is rising, shining in your eyes
Suddenly you're gone
And I'm left here all alone
Oh yeh
Am I dreaming?
Were you really here?
Is it just a fantasy?
Or am I dreaming
Oh yeh
Am I dreaming?
Were you really here?
Is it just a fantasy?
Or am I dreaming
Oh yeh
I know you're here
I can feel your presence
And that sound you're making
It's getting me so hot
Oh yeh
Am I dreaming?
Were you really here?
Is it just a fantasy?
Or am I dreaming
Oh yeh

Used to be the trouble maker
Hated homework, was a sweet heart breaker
But now I have my dream
I'm so rowdy for eighteen
Never read a single book
Hated homework and the dirty looks
But now I live my life
There's a lot I've seen at eighteen, oh yeah
School days, school days
I'm older now and what will I find about my
School day, school days
I'm starting to slip, I'm losin' my mind
Used to be the wild one
Hated class only lived for fun
I'm mean and got my schemes
At the crazy age of eighteen
Never made the honor roll
Hated rules what I was told
Now I am almost free
It's a dangerous scene when you're eighteen, oh yeah
School days, school days
I'm older now and what will I find about my
School day, school days
I'm starting to slip, I'm losin' my mind
School days, school days
I'm older now and what will I find about my
School day, school days
I'm starting to slip, I'm losin' my mind
School days, school days
I'm older now and what will I find about my
School day, school days
I'm starting to slip, I'm losin' my mind
School days, school days
I'm older now and what

You've got me runnin' round in circles
Tied my little brothers to a railroad track
In the black of the night you sit and pant
Crammed them all together in a plastic bag
You're a night prowler, you're a night howler, yeh
Trash can murders
In the black of night
Trash can murders
When will it be alright
Walk the streets and you're dressed in black
You tied their hands behind their backs
That's cold yeh, ya know it's true
Just wait and see what happens to you
You're a night prowler, you're a night howler, yeh
Trash can murders
In the black of night
Trash can murders
When will it be alright
I can hear him scream, it's midnight
In the alley like a Chinese cat
I've got a hatchet gonna take your life
Oh yeh, tell me, what ya think of that
I'm a night prowler, I'm a night howler yeh
Trash can murders
In the black of night
Trash can murders
When will it be alright

I met you last night, it was really alright
We got along
We partied awhile, you gave me the smile
Nothin' went wrong
Hold me close, hold me really tight
Go ahead, make me feel alright
Don't go away, I'm so happy
You're just what I need to make it
Don't go away, I'm so happy
You're just what I need ooooh!
The very next day, you saw us play
It was really a kick
Drippin' in sweat, I got very wet, honey
You did the trick
Hold me close, hold me really tight
Go ahead, make me feel alright
Don't go away, I'm so happy
You're just what I need to make it
Don't go away, I'm so happy
You're just what I need ooooh!
I stayed the night, it was really alright
I need our heat
I got kinda cold, you got really bold
Ya said, "Come to me."
Hold me close, hold me really tight
Go ahead, make me feel alright
Don't go away, I'm so happy
You're just what I need to make it
Don't go away, I'm so happy
You're just what I need ooooh!

Shades of gray don't fade away
They're waitin' for the night
Goin' out is what we're about
We're waitin' for the night
Friends and foes movin' fast and movin' slow
We're waitin' for the night
Hangin' around so astounded
Waitin' for the night
Waitin' for the night
Waitin' for the night
Days are taken
Waitin' for the night
At the hall havin' a ball
Waitin' for the night
Don't care, don't care at all
Cause we've seen, we've seen it all
Waitin' for the night
Waitin' for the night
Waitin' for the night
Days are taken
Waitin' for the night

Let me out of your iron grip
I don't want your lover's tips
I don't need your interrogations
Don't ask me 'bout my other relations
You're too possessive for me
So leave me alone
Get off my back, go on home
You're too possessive for me
So get out of my life
Get off my back, I ain't your wife
I come in late and you throw a fit
You sit me down and give me some lip
Well, I don't have to waste my time
A wimp like you ain't worth a dime
You're too possessive for me
So leave me alone
Get off my back, go on home
You're too possessive for me
So get out of my life
Get off my back, I ain't your wife
No way, baby
Go away an' don't come back
I don't want my mirror cracked
Go and find somebody new
Got no time to mess with you
You're too possessive for me
So leave me alone
Get off my back, go on home
You're too possessive for me
So get out of my life
Get off my back, I ain't your wife
No way, baby

With a pinch of rock and a dose of roll
I can warm you up if you get too cold
I can bring you up when you're going down
I can smash your head all over this town
You gave me the answer
Now I got the answer, oh yeah
'Cause we're the queens of noise
Come and get it boys
Queens of noise
Not just one of your toys
Queens of noise
I remember you at our second show
You were holding on and you wouldn't let go
And I bet you'll always be that way
Whenever you see us start to play
You gave me the answer
Now I got the answer, oh yeah
'Cause we're the queens of noise
Come and get it boys
Queens of noise
Not just one of your toys
Queens of noise
Queens of noise
Come and get it boys
Queens of noise
Not just one of your toys
Queens of noise
Come and get it boys
Queens of noise
Not just one of your toys
Queens of noise

You know that I'm not an angel
I told you when you walked in the door
You know that you make me happy
Better than the time before
Take it or leave it
Do whatever you want
Take it or leave it
Do whatever you want to me
You know that you're just a playmate
What are you trying to gain
Lead me into the darkness
To play our little nightime games
Take it or leave it
Do whatever you want
Take it or leave it
Do whatever you want to me
You say you wanna be with me
I see it in you
It's only a one night stand
And then we're through
You know that it makes me sad
To see how you feel for me
I gotta start movin' on
Someone else is waitin' for me
Take it or leave it
Do whatever you want
Take it or leave it
Do whatever you want to me

Out here in the smokey places
Looking into those empty faces
Short wave says we made the dial
I'm wired for ten million miles
Making midnight music
Singing rock and roll songs
Living midnight music
Just to get along
Back here in this cold hotel
I'm bored but you can tell
Your smile said we did ok
I'm glad we had a chance to play
Making midnight music
Singing rock and roll songs
Living midnight music
Just to get along
From the plane I see the back roads
Your twilight cities your super towns
From the stage I see the drifters
Lost souls who ain't been found
Out there in the five buck seats
We live inside your own heartbeats
We share the falls you take
Everything feels like it's just bout to break
Making midnight music
Singing rock and roll songs
Living midnight music
Just to get along

Bodies without minds
I hear you're the ones with the bleeding hearts
Blue and bitter sweet
You tear my dreams apart.
'Cause I was born to be bad
I'm not sad
And I'm glad I did it
Born to be bad
I'm not sad
I think you should all get with it.
The damn don't cry
Cry out when they're betrayed
Bodies slam, they scream
As the keynote fades.
'Cause I was born to be bad
I'm not sad
And I'm glad I did it
Born to be bad
I'm not sad
Yeah.
How many times has the Lord called to you
Accused you of somethin' that you haven't copped to
Yeah, it happens there just was a night
My boyfriend Larry came up to me and he said
"I think you've been a, I think you've been a bad girl
Because you've been acting very bad"
I said "Yeah, because it's my world
And I've been all too bad"
I said "I suppose you care less, I think you'd better go home now
I don't want to see you no more".
I said "Baby, oh baby
I really hate to leave you
But I know there's someone else out there
That I can go home with
So, my dear, go on home, go home
You know what I'm talkin' about?"
I want ya to bring me daises
For my mad desires
And if it bites the dust
I guess you're just gonna have to miss my fire.
I was born to bad
I'm not sad
And I'm glad I did it
Born to be bad
I'm not sad
And I'm glad I did it.

No one here gets out alive
Pushing power in overdrive
Cobra kings wet and wild
Love the devil that's in your smile
Let me tell you what we've been doin'
Neon angels on the road to ruin
Let me tell you what we've been doin'
Neon angels on the road to ruin
Everybody who's ever on fire
Now's the time for hearts desire
Let me tell you what we've been doin'
Neon angels on the road to ruin
Highways hard in this modern world
Battered boys and shattered girls
Leather bombers that rule the streets
Setting fires and living heat
Let me tell you what we've been doin'
Neon angels on the road to ruin

My one and only shining star said stick with me and I'll take you far
Your eyes are sparklin with teenage fire
I'll satisfy your mad desire
I love playin' with fire
I don't wanna get burned
I love playin' with fire
Don't think I'll ever learn, no!
My heart is achin' to see you play
And I can't wait
Till another day
The way you shake me, is really hot
You know how to use
What you got you know
I love playin' with fire
I don't wanna get burned
I love playin' with fire
Don't think I'll ever learn
Actin' tough with looks that kill
You got me goin' and I can't stand still
My arms are dyin' to hold you tight
Well you're my little dark dynamite you know
I love playin' with fire
I don't wanna get burned
I love playin' with fire
Don't think I'll ever learn

Turn up that radio
Hear the rock and roll
Malibu shines like summer gold
Wild beaches
In the salty wind
California summers never end
California - you're so nice
California - your paradise
The kids are ripping up the streets
In their super cars
All night parties and loud guitars
Hot hot neighbourhoods
Its the silver sound
Wicked Hollywood goes round and round
California - you're so nice
California - your paradise

Each night alone I dream
That I'm a rebel roller queen
I'll be a star that shines
I can make the whole world mine
Hollywood it feels so good
Hollywood it feels so good
Each day at home I scheme
For the fame and fortune dream
Gonna be a superstar
With my fancy clothes and cars
Hollywood it feels so good
Hollywood it feels so good
I can make it, make it, make it, make it
'Cause I can take it, take it, take it, take it
Each time the radio plays
It tells of the golden days
Living fast on the go
Lets get on with the show yeah
Hollywood it feels so good
Hollywood it feels so good


Thousands cheered as you appeared
The band was playing
We drove away that saturday
I wanted you knew where you were staying
Backstage lied about my age
Didn't care that you were older
Stop look listen to my heartbeat
Stop look listen to my heartbeat
Here you are a superstar
But I sing and play in my own way
You got your fans and I got mine
But I need your love that's the bottom line
I sing lead and so do you
Get together what will we do?
Stop look listen to my heartbeat
Stop look listen to my heartbeat
Danced all night till the room was light
You said goodbye I wondered why
Radio played you couldn't stay
You'd miss your plane in the morning rain
Here I am in the limousine
Once again the lonely queen
Stop look listen to my heartbeat
Stop look listen to my heartbeat

I got myself a bad lover
His name is Johnny Guitar lookout
Go for it Johnny
All night long
Go for it Johnny
That's where I'm coming from
My fingers roll his body
Making him scream
And I'm lost in a metal dream
Go for it Johnny
All night long
Go for it Johnny
That's where I'm coming from
Hot hands on his wet neck
I'm a hunter he's my gun
Go for it Johnny
All night long
Go for it Johnny
That's where I'm coming from
